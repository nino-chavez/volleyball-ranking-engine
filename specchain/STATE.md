## Key Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Context |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-02-23 | All-TypeScript (no Python) | 73x73 Colley Matrix is trivially small for ml-matrix; unified stack benefits outweigh Python's numerical ecosystem | Tech stack decision |
| 2026-02-23 | Individual match records as base granularity | Enables future enhancement with set scores/point differentials; H2H summaries derived via queries | Schema design |
| 2026-02-23 | Ranking snapshots over recompute | Preserves historical rankings; enables trend analysis | Schema design |
| 2026-02-23 | Zod v4 top-level format validators | Used z.uuid(), z.iso.datetime(), z.iso.date() instead of deprecated z.string().uuid() etc. | Zod v4 compatibility |
| 2026-02-23 | Adaptive Finishes parser with Row 2 triplet scanning | Scans Row 2 for Div/Fin/Tot patterns starting at column 10 to detect tournament boundaries; handles merged cells, padding columns, and header-only tournaments | Import parser design |
| 2026-02-23 | Supabase RPC for atomic replace mode | PostgreSQL function bodies are inherently transactional; Supabase JS client cannot provide multi-table transaction guarantees | Database atomicity |
| 2026-02-23 | Server-side Excel parsing | xlsx library runs on the server (API endpoint) to avoid shipping SheetJS to the browser; client sends raw file, server returns structured JSON | Architecture decision |
| 2026-02-23 | Separate server-side Supabase client | Created `supabase-server.ts` using `$env/static/private` for service role key, keeping it separate from client-side `supabase.ts` | SvelteKit security model |
| 2026-02-23 | Built-in Levenshtein distance | ~20 lines of standard DP rather than adding an external dependency; exported for direct testing | Dependency minimization |
| 2026-02-23 | Optional weightMap parameter for backward compatibility | `weightMap?: Record<string, number>` defaults to 1.0 per tournament; existing tests pass without modification | Weighted algorithm design |
| 2026-02-23 | Seeding factors optional on RankingRunOutput | `seeding_factors?: SeedingFactors[]` avoids breaking existing service tests; returned from run API, not re-computed in results API | Verifier fix for type breakage |
| 2026-02-23 | Seeding factors from run endpoint, not results endpoint | Run API already computes seeding factors; avoids complex re-derivation of pairwise data in results GET endpoint | Verifier fix for double computation |
| 2026-02-23 | PUT replaces weights for season | PUT /api/ranking/weights upserts on (tournament_id, season_id) unique constraint; absent entries keep defaults | Weights API design |

## Patterns Established
- Migration naming: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`
- Zod schema pattern: each table gets `fooSchema`, `fooInsertSchema` (omit id/timestamps), `fooUpdateSchema` (partial), and `Foo` type
- Shared enums in `src/lib/schemas/enums.ts` reused across schemas
- Barrel export from `src/lib/schemas/index.ts`
- All tables include id (UUID), created_at, updated_at with auto-update trigger
- Tests organized: `tests/schemas/` for Zod, `tests/integration/` for structural/DB
- Import module structure: types in `src/lib/import/types.ts`, parsers in `src/lib/import/parsers/`, services in `src/lib/import/`, barrel export in `src/lib/import/parsers/index.ts`
- Mock Supabase pattern: factory function `createMockSupabase()` mimics PostgREST query-builder chain for unit tests
- Svelte 5 runes: `$state` for mutable state, `$derived` for computed state, `$props` for component props -- no legacy reactive syntax
- UI component tests as logic unit tests (pure functions) when `@testing-library/svelte` is not available
- Test fixtures generated programmatically via `XLSX.utils.aoa_to_sheet()` + `XLSX.write()` inside test files
- Pure algorithm functions accept optional `weightMap` parameter; service layer builds the map from DB
- Seeding factors computed as pure function from pairwise records and Tier-1 finishes; not stored in DB
- Design system: semantic CSS custom properties (--color-accent, --text-primary, etc.) with Tailwind v4 `@theme` integration
- Component library: Card, Select, Button, Banner, PageHeader, DataTable, TierRow, RankBadge, FreshnessIndicator
