# Executive Technical Health Assessment

**Project:** Volleyball Ranking Engine
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Assessor:** CTO Advisory Review
**Status:** All 9 planned features complete; pre-production

---

## Business Context

The Volleyball Ranking Engine computes defensible, transparent team rankings for AAU volleyball across four age groups (15U, 16U, 17U, 18U). It uses a five-algorithm ensemble (Colley Matrix + four Elo variants) to produce aggregate rankings that committees can review, override with audit trails, and export for distribution.

All nine planned features have been delivered. The application is functional but not yet hardened for production use. This assessment identifies the gaps between "feature-complete" and "production-ready" and provides a prioritized action plan.

## Health Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Verdict |
|-----------|:-----:|---------|
| Code Quality | **7/10** | Strong TypeScript usage with Zod validation; significant repetition in algo1-algo5 pattern across 30 files |
| Test Coverage | **8/10** | 180 tests across 36 files covering ~118 source files; good ratio of test LOC to production LOC (4,916 vs 8,762) |
| Dependency Health | **6/10** | Modern stack (Svelte 5, Vite 7, TypeScript 5.9); `xlsx` package has known license concerns; package still named "svelte-scaffold" |
| Security Posture | **3/10** | No authentication, no authorization, no rate limiting, no CSRF protection; service role key used server-side without access control |
| Documentation | **7/10** | CLAUDE.md is comprehensive; 4 ADRs and 4 architecture diagrams exist; developer, testing, ops, and user docs being generated |
| Architecture | **8/10** | Clean separation of concerns; file-based routing; service layer pattern; Zod schemas at boundaries; well-structured monolith |

**Overall Health: 6.5/10** -- Architecturally sound and well-tested, but security gaps and deployment readiness prevent production use.

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **Defensible algorithm design.** The five-algorithm ensemble with normalization and deterministic tie-breaking produces rankings that can withstand scrutiny from coaches, parents, and committee members. This is the core value proposition and it is well-implemented with 180 passing tests.

2. **Clean architectural boundaries.** The codebase separates import parsing, ranking computation, normalization, export generation, and API endpoints into distinct modules. Each module has its own types, schemas, and test files. This makes the system maintainable and extensible.

3. **Strong validation layer.** Zod schemas validate data at every boundary (file upload, API request, database response). This prevents corrupt data from entering the ranking pipeline, which is critical for trust in the output.

4. **Comprehensive test suite.** The test-to-production code ratio (56% by line count) covers unit tests, integration tests, edge cases, determinism verification, backward compatibility, and accessibility. Test files mirror the source structure, making them easy to locate and maintain.

### Risks

1. **No authentication or authorization (Critical).** Every API endpoint is publicly accessible. Anyone with the URL can trigger ranking computations, modify tournament weights, apply committee overrides, or delete data. For a system that produces official rankings, this is a blocking issue for production deployment.

2. **Hardcoded five-algorithm pattern (Medium).** The `algo1`-`algo5` naming convention is hardcoded across 30 files (types, schemas, database columns, UI components, import/export logic). Adding a sixth algorithm or removing one would require coordinated changes across the entire codebase and a database migration. This is manageable today but becomes increasingly expensive as the codebase grows.

3. **No CI/CD pipeline (Medium).** No GitHub Actions, no deployment configuration, no automated quality gates. Every build, test, and deploy is manual. This increases the risk of shipping broken code and makes it difficult to maintain the current quality bar as the team grows.

4. **Package identity not established (Low).** The project is still named "svelte-scaffold" in `package.json` at version `0.0.1`. While cosmetic, this signals an incomplete project setup and could cause confusion in dependency management or monitoring tools.

## Recommended Actions

| Priority | Action | Effort | Impact | Timeline |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| P0 | Add authentication via Supabase Auth (RLS + JWT) | 2-3 days | Eliminates the single largest production blocker | Week 1 |
| P0 | Add role-based authorization (admin, committee, viewer) | 1-2 days | Prevents unauthorized ranking modifications | Week 1 |
| P1 | Set up CI pipeline (GitHub Actions: lint, type-check, test, build) | 0.5 days | Automates quality gates; prevents regressions | Week 2 |
| P1 | Add ESLint + Prettier configuration | 0.5 days | Enforces consistent code style across contributors | Week 2 |
| P1 | Rename package and set proper version | 0.5 hours | Establishes project identity | Week 2 |
| P2 | Refactor algo1-algo5 to dynamic algorithm registry | 3-5 days | Enables algorithm addition/removal without full-stack changes | Week 3-4 |
| P2 | Add deployment configuration (Vercel/Netlify adapter) | 1 day | Enables reproducible deployments | Week 3 |
| P2 | Add error monitoring (Sentry or equivalent) | 0.5 days | Enables proactive issue detection in production | Week 3 |
| P3 | Add rate limiting to API endpoints | 1 day | Prevents abuse and accidental resource exhaustion | Week 4 |
| P3 | Add database backup strategy documentation | 0.5 days | Supabase handles backups, but RTO/RPO should be documented | Week 4 |

## Investment Summary

The Volleyball Ranking Engine has a solid foundation. The core domain logic (ranking algorithms, import pipeline, export module) is well-architected and thoroughly tested. The primary investment needed is in security and operational readiness, not feature development.

**Estimated effort to production readiness:** 2-3 weeks of focused work.

**Risk of deploying without remediation:** High. The absence of authentication means any user can manipulate rankings, which would undermine the credibility of the entire system.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize P0 security items before any production deployment. The P1 items (CI/CD, linting) should follow immediately to protect the quality bar as the project transitions from single-developer to team maintenance. P2 and P3 items can be addressed in parallel with early production use in a controlled environment.
