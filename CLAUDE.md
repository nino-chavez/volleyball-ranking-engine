# Project: Volleyball Ranking Engine

## Identity

A web application that computes, reviews, and exports team rankings for AAU volleyball across four age groups (15U, 16U, 17U, 18U) using a five-algorithm ensemble approach (Colley Matrix + four Elo variants with different starting ratings).

**Type:** Monolith

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.9
- **Framework:** SvelteKit 2.50 (Svelte 5 with runes: `$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS 4.2 (Vite plugin, no PostCSS)
- **Database:** Supabase (hosted PostgreSQL) -- 9 tables, 2 RPC functions, 15 migrations, 2 custom enums
- **Validation:** Zod 4.3
- **Testing:** Vitest 4.0 with jsdom, Testing Library (Svelte)
- **Math:** ml-matrix (LU decomposition for Colley), custom Elo implementation
- **Export:** jspdf + jspdf-autotable (PDF), xlsx (XLSX), custom CSV
- **Infrastructure:** Supabase managed service (no self-hosted infra)
- **CI/CD:** None configured (manual deployment)

## Documentation Standards

- **Format:** GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- **Diagrams:** Mermaid.js (embedded in Markdown)
- **Structure:** Diataxis framework for user documentation
- **Location:** `docs/` directory
- **Naming:** kebab-case for files, Title Case for headers

### Style Guide

- Use active voice
- Present tense for current behavior
- Second person ("you") for instructions
- No emoji unless explicitly requested
- Code blocks with language tags

## Project-Specific Context

### Domain Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Age Group | Competition division by player age: 15U, 16U, 17U, 18U |
| Colley Matrix | Time-independent ranking algorithm solving Cr=b via LU decomposition |
| Elo Rating | Chronological rating algorithm with configurable starting values (2200, 2400, 2500, 2700) |
| AggRating | Aggregate rating: arithmetic mean of 5 normalized algorithm scores (0-100 scale) |
| AggRank | Final rank derived by sorting AggRating descending with alphabetical tie-breaking |
| Tournament Weight | Multiplier (0.0-5.0) applied to tournament results across all algorithms |
| Ranking Run | A single computation of rankings for a season + age group, stored with parameters and status |
| Override | Committee-applied manual adjustment to a team's rank position |
| Finalization | Locking a ranking run to prevent further modifications |
| Finishes Import | Uploading XLSX files with tournament placement data |
| Colley Import | Uploading XLSX files with pre-computed Colley ratings |
| Identity Resolution | Matching imported team names to existing teams in the database |
| Seeding Factors | Sub-factors (Strength of Schedule, Win Rate) contributing to tiebreaking |

### Architectural Decisions

- **ADR-001:** Five-algorithm ensemble ranking (Colley + 4 Elo variants) for defensible, transparent rankings
- **ADR-002:** Supabase monolith -- single managed PostgreSQL database for all data, no microservices
- **ADR-003:** Two-phase import (upload preview -> confirm) with identity resolution for safe data ingestion
- **ADR-004:** Committee override workflow with audit trail (reason required, original rank preserved)

### External Dependencies

| Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Supabase | Managed PostgreSQL database | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` env vars |

### Database Schema (9 Tables)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `seasons` | Competition seasons with year and name |
| `teams` | Teams with name, age_group, and club |
| `tournaments` | Tournament events with name, date, location |
| `tournament_weights` | Per-season weight multipliers for each tournament |
| `tournament_results` | Team placement (finish position) at each tournament |
| `matches` | Individual game results (team_a, team_b, score, winner) |
| `ranking_runs` | Ranking computation snapshots with parameters, status, age_group |
| `ranking_results` | Per-team algorithm scores and final rank within a run |
| `ranking_overrides` | Committee overrides with old_rank, new_rank, reason |
