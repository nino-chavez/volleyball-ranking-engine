# Reference: Data Format Specifications

This document specifies the exact column layouts and data types for all file formats used by the Volleyball Ranking Engine: import spreadsheets and export files.

---

## Import Formats

### Finishes Spreadsheet Format

The finishes spreadsheet records tournament placement data. It uses a multi-row header layout where tournament names are in Row 1 and sub-column headers are in Row 2.

#### Layout Overview

```
Row 1:  [Team fields]  |  Tournament A (merged)   |  Tournament B (merged)   |  ...  |  [Summary cols]
Row 2:  [Team headers]  |  Div  | Fin  | Tot      |  Div  | Fin  | Tot       |  ...  |  [Summary cols]
Row 3:  Team 1 data      |  Open |  1   |  32      |  Club |  3   |  16       |  ...  |  ...
Row 4:  Team 2 data      |  Open |  5   |  32      |       |      |           |  ...  |  ...
...
```

#### Team Columns (A-J)

| Column | Name | Data Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (col 0) | Team Name | Text | Yes | Full team name |
| B (col 1) | Team Code | Text | Yes | Short team identifier code |
| C-J (cols 2-9) | Varies | Varies | No | Additional team-level fields (ignored by the parser) |

#### Tournament Columns (K onward)

Tournament data starts at column K (index 10). Each tournament occupies exactly 3 consecutive columns. There may be empty padding columns between tournaments.

**Row 1 (tournament names):**
- Tournament names appear in merged cells spanning 3 columns each.
- The parser reads the leftmost cell of each merged region to get the tournament name.

**Row 2 (sub-headers):**
- The parser scans for the pattern `Div`, `Fin`, `Tot` (case-insensitive) in three consecutive cells.
- Only columns matching this triplet pattern are treated as valid tournament data.

**Data rows (Row 3+):**

| Sub-column | Header | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | Div | Text | Division code (e.g., "Open", "Club", "National") |
| 2nd | Fin | Integer | Finish position (1 = first place). Required if Tot is present. |
| 3rd | Tot | Integer | Field size (total number of teams). Required if Fin is present. |

**Rules:**
- If both Fin and Tot are empty for a team at a tournament, the row is skipped for that tournament (the team did not attend).
- If Fin is present but not a valid integer, an error is reported.
- If Tot is present but not a valid integer, an error is reported.
- The last 5 columns of the spreadsheet are treated as summary columns and are excluded from parsing.

#### Example

| | A | B | ... | K | L | M | N | O | P |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Row 1** | | | | AAU Nationals (merged K-M) | | | Regionals East (merged N-P) | | |
| **Row 2** | Team Name | Code | ... | Div | Fin | Tot | Div | Fin | Tot |
| **Row 3** | Tigers VBC | TGR | ... | Open | 1 | 32 | Club | 5 | 16 |
| **Row 4** | Eagles VBC | EGL | ... | Open | 8 | 32 | | | |

In this example:
- Tigers VBC finished 1st out of 32 at AAU Nationals (Open division) and 5th out of 16 at Regionals East (Club division).
- Eagles VBC finished 8th out of 32 at AAU Nationals and did not attend Regionals East.

### Colley Spreadsheet Format

The Colley spreadsheet uses a simple flat-table layout with fixed column positions.

| Column | Index | Header | Data Type | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 0 | Team | Text | Yes |
| B | 1 | teamcode | Text | Yes |
| C | 2 | Wins | Integer | Yes |
| D | 3 | Losses | Integer | Yes |
| E | 4 | Algo1Rating | Decimal | No |
| F | 5 | Algo1Rank | Integer | No |
| G | 6 | Algo2Rating | Decimal | No |
| H | 7 | Algo2Rank | Integer | No |
| I | 8 | Algo3Rating | Decimal | No |
| J | 9 | Algo3Rank | Integer | No |
| K | 10 | Algo4Rating | Decimal | No |
| L | 11 | Algo4Rank | Integer | No |
| M | 12 | Algo5Rating | Decimal | No |
| N | 13 | Algo5Rank | Integer | No |
| O | 14 | AggRating | Decimal | No |
| P | 15 | AggRank | Integer | No |

**Rules:**
- Row 1 is the header row (skipped during parsing).
- Rows 2+ are data rows.
- Empty rows (both Team and teamcode empty) are skipped.
- If Team is present but teamcode is empty (or vice versa), an error is reported.
- Wins and Losses are required; all algorithm columns are optional.
- Non-numeric values in numeric columns produce errors.
- Non-integer values in rank columns produce warnings.

#### Algorithm Column Mapping

| Column | Algorithm |
|---|---|
| Algo1 | Colley Matrix |
| Algo2 | Elo (starting rating 2200) |
| Algo3 | Elo (starting rating 2400) |
| Algo4 | Elo (starting rating 2500) |
| Algo5 | Elo (starting rating 2700) |

## Export Formats

### CSV Export Format

The CSV export follows RFC 4180 conventions.

**Structure:**

1. **Metadata comments** (prefixed with `#`):
   ```
   # Season: 2025-2026 Season
   # Age Group: 18U
   # Run At: 2026-02-24T10:35:00.000Z
   # Teams Ranked: 45
   # Status: draft
   # Exported At: 2026-02-24T11:00:00.000Z
   ```

2. **Blank line**

3. **Column headers** (comma-separated)

4. **Data rows** (one per team, sorted by final rank ascending)

5. **Override summary** (if overrides exist):
   ```

   # Override Summary
   Team,Original Rank,Final Rank,Justification,Committee Member
   "Team ABC",5,3,"Strong late-season performance","Jane Doe"
   ```

**Summary columns (always present):**

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Final Rank | Integer | Final rank position (reflects overrides) |
| Team | Text | Team name |
| Region | Text | Geographic region |
| Agg Rating | Decimal (2 places) | Aggregate rating (0-100) |
| Agg Rank | Integer | Algorithmic aggregate rank |
| Win % | Decimal (1 place) or empty | Win percentage |
| Best National Finish | Integer or empty | Best Tier-1 tournament finish |

**Algorithm breakdown columns (when "Include algorithm breakdowns" is checked):**

| Column | Data Type |
|---|---|
| Algo 1 Rating | Decimal |
| Algo 1 Rank | Integer |
| Algo 2 Rating | Decimal |
| Algo 2 Rank | Integer |
| Algo 3 Rating | Decimal |
| Algo 3 Rank | Integer |
| Algo 4 Rating | Decimal |

| Override Original Rank | Integer or empty |
| Override Justification | Text or empty |
| Override Committee Member | Text or empty |

**Encoding:** UTF-8
**Line endings:** LF (`\n`)
**Field quoting:** Fields containing commas, double quotes, or newlines are enclosed in double quotes. Double quotes within fields are escaped as `""`.

### XLSX Export Format

The Excel export produces a standard `.xlsx` workbook.

**Sheet 1: "Rankings"**

| Row Range | Content |
|---|---|
| Rows 1-6 | Metadata (one field per row, single column): Season, Age Group, Run At, Teams Ranked, Status, Exported At |
| Row 7 | Blank separator |
| Row 8 | Column headers |
| Rows 9+ | Data rows (same columns as CSV) |

**Sheet 2: "Overrides"** (only present when overrides exist)

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| Team | Team name |
| Original Rank | Algorithmic rank |
| Final Rank | Committee-assigned rank |
| Justification | Override reason |
| Committee Member | Person who applied the override |

---

### PDF Export Format

The PDF report is generated as a formatted document.

**Page setup:**
- Paper size: Letter (8.5" x 11")
- Orientation: Landscape when algorithm breakdowns are included; Portrait when summary only
- Margins: 30pt left and right

**Content structure:**

1. **Title** (centered, 16pt): "Volleyball Rankings Report"
2. **Metadata block** (9pt, left-aligned): Season, age group, run date, teams ranked, status, export date
3. **Rankings table**:
   - Header row: Blue background (#29417A), white text
   - Body: 7pt font, 3pt cell padding
   - Same columns as CSV export
4. **Override Summary table** (if overrides exist):
   - Section heading: "Override Summary" (12pt)
   - Header row: Brown background (#825032), white text
   - Columns: Team, Original Rank, Final Rank, Justification, Committee Member
5. **Page numbers**: Centered footer, "Page X of Y" (8pt)

## File Naming Conventions

Export files follow a standardized naming pattern:

```
rankings_[AGE_GROUP]_[DATE].[ext]
```

| Component | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| AGE_GROUP | Age group with special characters replaced by underscores | `18U` |
| DATE | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) | `2026-02-24` |
| ext | File extension | `csv`, `xlsx`, `pdf` |

**Examples:**
- `rankings_18U_2026-02-24.csv`
- `rankings_15U_2026-02-24.xlsx`
- `rankings_17U_2026-02-24.pdf`
