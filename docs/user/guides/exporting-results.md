## Accessing the Export Feature

The Export button is available on the Rankings page after a ranking computation has been run or a previous run has been loaded.

1. Navigate to **Rankings** and run a ranking computation (or select a previous run from the dropdown).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the results table.
3. Click the **Export** button.

**What you should see:** A dropdown menu with the following options:
- A checkbox labeled "Include algorithm breakdowns"
- Three download buttons: **Download CSV**, **Download Excel**, and **Download PDF**

### Include Algorithm Breakdowns

Before choosing a format, you can check the **Include algorithm breakdowns** checkbox. This controls how much detail is included in the exported file:

| Setting | Columns Included |
|---|---|
| **Unchecked** (summary only) | Final Rank, Team, Region, Agg Rating, Agg Rank, Win %, Best National Finish |
| **Checked** (full detail) | All summary columns plus individual ratings and ranks for all 5 algorithms (Colley, Elo-2200, Elo-2400, Elo-2500, Elo-2700) |

If overrides are active, both modes also include: Override Original Rank, Override Justification, and Override Committee Member.

1. **Metadata header** (lines starting with `#`):
   - Season name
   - Age group
   - Run timestamp
   - Number of teams ranked
   - Run status (draft or finalized)
   - Export timestamp

2. **Column headers row**

3. **Data rows** (one per team, sorted by final rank)

4. **Override Summary section** (if overrides exist): A separate section listing each override with the team name, original rank, final rank, justification, and committee member.

**File format details:**
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Delimiter: Comma (`,`)

### Sheet 1: "Rankings"

- **Metadata rows** at the top (season, age group, run date, teams ranked, status, export date)
- A blank row separator
- **Column headers**
- **Data rows** (one per team, sorted by final rank)

### Sheet 2: "Overrides" (only present if overrides exist)

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| Team | Team name |
| Original Rank | The algorithmic rank before the override |
| Final Rank | The committee-assigned rank |
| Justification | The reason for the override |
| Committee Member | The name of the person who applied the override |

## PDF Report

**When to use:** When you need a formatted, print-ready document for official distribution, meeting handouts, or archival purposes.

**How to export:**
1. Click **Export**.

3. **Rankings table:** A formatted table with all data rows, using:
   - Blue header row with white text
   - Alternating row styling for readability
   - Landscape orientation when algorithm breakdowns are included (to fit the wider table)
   - Portrait orientation for summary-only exports

4. **Override Summary table** (if overrides exist): A separate table with a brown header, listing all overrides

5. **Page numbers:** Centered at the bottom of each page (e.g., "Page 1 of 3")

**Formatting notes:**
- Font size is 7pt for table content and 9pt for metadata to fit all columns
