## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework and is organized into four quadrants:

### Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)

Step-by-step lessons that take you through the complete workflow from start to finish.

- [Getting Started](tutorials/getting-started.md) -- Your first ranking, from data import to export

### Guides (Task-Oriented)

Practical instructions for accomplishing specific tasks.

- [Importing Data](guides/importing-data.md) -- Upload and validate tournament spreadsheets
- [Running Rankings](guides/running-rankings.md) -- Compute and review team rankings
- [Overrides and Finalization](guides/overrides-and-finalization.md) -- Apply committee adjustments and lock results
- [Exporting Results](guides/exporting-results.md) -- Download rankings as CSV, Excel, or PDF
- [Managing Tournament Weights](guides/tournament-weights.md) -- Control how much each tournament matters

### Reference (Information-Oriented)

Technical specifications and data format details.

- [API Reference](reference/api-reference.md) -- REST API endpoint documentation
- [Data Format Specifications](reference/data-formats.md) -- Spreadsheet column layouts and export formats

### Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)

Background information explaining how and why the system works the way it does.

- [How Rankings Work](explanation/ranking-algorithms.md) -- The five-algorithm ensemble approach explained in plain language
- [Understanding Tournament Weights](explanation/tournament-weights.md) -- Why different tournaments matter differently

## Application Overview

The Volleyball Ranking Engine computes team rankings for AAU volleyball across four age groups (15U, 16U, 17U, 18U). It uses a five-algorithm ensemble approach that combines one Colley Matrix rating with four Elo rating variants, averages them into a single aggregate score, and produces a final ranking.

### Main Pages

The application has three main sections, accessible from the navigation bar at the top of every page:

| Page | URL Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Import** | `/import` | Upload tournament data spreadsheets |
| **Rankings** | `/ranking` | Run ranking computations and review results |
| **Weights** | `/ranking/weights` | Manage tournament importance weights |

### Typical Workflow

1. **Import** tournament finishes data from an Excel spreadsheet
2. **Adjust weights** for each tournament (optional)
3. **Run** the ranking computation for a season and age group
4. **Review** the results table
5. **Override** specific team positions if the committee decides (optional)
6. **Finalize** the ranking run to lock it from further changes
7. **Export** the results as CSV, Excel, or PDF
